## Chrono

Chrono is a minimalist focus & task-timer app designed to help you complete daily tasks with intention.
Unlike traditional to-do apps, Chrono assigns a countdown to each task, promoting deep focus and time awareness.

💡 Why Chrono?

	• ⏳ Time-bound tasks encourage focused sessions
	• 🔒 Deep Focus Mode discards progress if the countdown is interrupted.
	• 🎧 Ambient sounds play even in the background, lock screen, and silent mode.
	• 📅 Daily tasks reset every new day automatically.
	• 📊 Calendar view helps track daily progress, goals, and focus time.
